## Getting Started

Welcome to the Games in Java repository. This is primarily built as a test of ideas, and a small project to keep me busy!

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

(Thanks to VSCode!
)
## How to Run

If you choose to run this code, you'll need to download it, compile everything in the src folder, and then run App.java. The rest should explain itself!
